## SXV

**SXV** provides quick and easy viewing access to XBRL taxonomies and XBRL documents. 

An XBRL taxonomy is a collection of business reporting terms for a given reporting focus (i.e. financial reporting, earnings releases, tax reporting information, etc.) 
or industry (i.e. commercial and industrial, insurance, banking, etc.) that allows you to “mark up” or map your financial data to specific, agreed-upon reporting concepts. 
Two “types” of XBRL taxonomies are commonly referred to when working with XBRL taxonomies: “standard base” and “company extension” taxonomies.
From an XBRL 2.1 Specification standpoint, all XBRL taxonomies are created the same way. The use of the terms “standard base” and “company extension” 
when referring to XBRL taxonomies simply helps users better understand the difference between how these taxonomies are created and used by the market.
Standard base taxonomies are typically provided by authoritative or regulatory bodies or the local jurisdiction of XBRL International. 
Examples of standard base taxonomies are US GAAP Financial Reporting Taxonomy and IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). 
Company extension taxonomies are created by companies or industry groups that “extend” a standard base taxonomy by adding additional information 
specific to a given company's or industry's type of reporting needs. A company extension taxonomy imports all of the information of a standard 
base taxonomy and allows additions or changes to the information contained in the standard base taxonomy without altering the integrity of the 
standard base taxonomy itself.
SXV provides full support for both standard base and company extension taxonomies. Information contained within these taxonomies is presented 
by default based upon the presentation aspect of the given taxonomy (referred to as information contained in the presentation linkbase or 
presentation hierarchy) with additional options based upon the calculation (referred to as information contained in the calculation linkbase 
or calculation hierarchy) or element (flat alphabetic list) aspect also available.
An XBRL document, on the other hand, is a collection of report data or “facts” created by a company that represents all or part of a business report. 
An XBRL document is, in its simplest form, the XBRL representation of existing business report information put in a globally- agreed upon technology easily understood by computers.
The XBRL document contains information such as entity information (the company that the XBRL information came from), time periods, business segments, 
currency codes and amounts. It also contains the XBRL taxonomy elements (from standard base and/or extension taxonomies) that the company has identified as 
being specifically related to its financial information. The power of an XBRL document is that it communicates business report information in a common 
“language” while not forcing a company to change its reporting format or supply additional information (beyond what it already supplies today.
Although the XBRL document and XBRL taxonomy(s) are different physical files, SXV quickly and easily combines the content of the XBRL document with 
the related XBRL taxonomies to provide a single, report-like view of the information that is formatted like an accountant or financial professional 
would expect -like that of a structured financial statement/report.
